1. As it a new project and everything is containerised I've used java 21 it's LTS, so I hope it fits for you requirement of a supported java version. Majorly I did it due to Spring boot 3.3 java virtual threads support.

Assumptions:
1. The winners list is till 2010, and it's 2024 now, so I assume it isn't changed often, thus no special update mechanism is created.
2. The rating part is only for "Best picture" Oscar films.
