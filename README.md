## It's Movies-API

Initial task:
Create a Java web application. The application should Indicate whether a movie won a “Best Picture” Oscar, given a movie’s title based on this and this thatAPI CSV file
contains winners from 1927 until 2010. It should also allow users to give a rating to movies and provide a list of 10 top-rated movies ordered by
box office value.

And here you can find a list of the documentation files:

- [solution.md](documentation/solution.md) – a short (min two lines, max half a page) description of the solution and explaining some design decisions
- [how_to_run.md](documentation/how_to_run.md) - a short explanation about how to run the solution with all the needed parts
- [how_to_test.md](documentation/how_to_test.md) file explaining what needs to be done to use the service.
- [to_do.md](documentation/to_do.md) - to-do list with things you would add if you have more time or explaining what is missing and why etc
- [assumptions.md](documentation/assumptions.md) – your assumptions when solving the challenge
- [scale.md](documentation/scale.md) – a description of how it will scale when the number of users/agents/consumers grows from 100 per day to 10000000 per day,
and what changes would have to be made to keep the same quality of service



P.S.
Sorry for the braces layout:) I'm using it for my current project and quite used to it, but it could look odd.
