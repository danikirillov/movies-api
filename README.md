And here you can find a list of the documentation files:

- [how_to_run.md](documentation/how_to_run.md) - a short explanation about how to run the solution with all the needed parts
- [how_to_test.md](documentation/how_to_test.md) file explaining what needs to be done to use the service.
- [to_do.md](documentation/to_do.md) - to-do list with things you would add if you have more time or explaining what is missing and why etc
- [assumptions.md](documentation/assumptions.md) – your assumptions when solving the challenge
- [scale.md](documentation/scale.md) – a description of how it will scale when the number of users/agents/consumers grows from 100 per day to 10000000 per day,
and what changes would have to be made to keep the same quality of service



P.S.
Sorry for braces layout:) I'm using it for my current project and quite used to it, but it could look odd.
